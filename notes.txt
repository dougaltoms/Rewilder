Used in ML model to convert categorical data into numerical values. Can be done using pandas or sklearn

# Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Selects features in a training dataset which are most suitable for predicting target variable

# Multi-Target Regression
Produces significantly better r^2 value (-0.1 -> 0.95) as increased granularity so better pattern/relationship
learning specific to each species rather than combined
